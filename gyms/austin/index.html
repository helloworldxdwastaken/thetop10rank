                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                
                <h3>Can I try a gym before joining?</h3>
                <p>Yes. All ranked gyms offer trial visits (1-7 days free). Request specific trial during your normal workout time to assess crowding and equipment availability. Avoid tours during off-peak hours—they're not representative.</p>
                
                <h3>Are Austin gyms crowded?</h3>
                <p>Peak hours (6-8am, 5-7pm weekdays) see significant crowding at popular gyms. Castle Hill (#1) and Zilker Fitness (#6) manage this best with ample equipment. Specialty gyms (#2, #3, #7) have built-in crowd control through training style or class schedules.</p>
                
                <h3>Do I need a car to access these gyms?</h3>
                <p>Downtown/central options (#1, #5) accessible via public transit and bike. Most other locations require car—parking available at all ranked gyms. Several gyms on major bus routes.</p>
                
                <h3>Which gyms have the best childcare?</h3>
                <p>Castle Hill Fitness (#1) and Mueller Wellness Center (#8) offer supervised childcare (included with premium memberships). Hours typically 8am-1pm and 4-7pm weekdays, limited weekend hours. Reserve spots during peak times.</p>
                
                <h3>Can I freeze my membership if I travel?</h3>
                <p>Most gyms allow 1-3 month freezes per year for $10-20/month. Read contracts carefully—budget gyms may not offer this. Useful for summer travel or injury recovery.</p>
