                <h1>About Rankin</h1>
                <p style="font-size: 20px; color: #6b7280; max-width: 800px;">We're building a trusted resource for
                    finding the best local services through independent, data-driven rankings that put helpful
                    information ahead of marketing.</p>

                <h2 style="margin-top: 60px;">Our Mission</h2>
                <p>The internet is flooded with "best of" lists that are either paid placements, aggregated reviews
                    without verification, or clickbait content farms. We believe people deserve better—rankings based on
                    actual research, transparent criteria, and editorial independence.</p>

                <p>Rankin exists to answer a simple question: <strong>"What's actually the best option for my specific
                        need?"</strong> We do the research, apply consistent evaluation frameworks, and publish rankings
                    that help you make confident decisions.</p>

                <h2>What Makes Us Different</h2>

                <h3>1. Editorial Independence & Commercial Transparency</h3>
                <h3>1. Editorial Independence & Commercial Transparency</h3>
                <p><strong>Rankings are never for sale.</strong> Our scores (1-10) are based strictly on our published
                    criteria. Whether a business pays or not has zero effect on their rank.</p>
                <p>However, verify, high-ranking businesses can upgrade to a **Premium Profile**. This allows them to
                    customize their page with high-res imagery, direct website links, and expanded team bios. Think of
                    it
                    as a "verified badge" with superpowers—it helps them look their best, but it doesn't buy them a
                    better score. We label these clearly so you always know when a profile is enhanced.</p>

                <h3>2. Transparent Methodology</h3>
                <p>We publish exactly how we evaluate and score every category. You can read our <a
                        href="/how-we-rank/">global methodology</a> and category-specific processes (e.g., <a
                        href="/design-studios/how-we-rank/">design studios</a>, <a
                        href="/dentists/how-we-rank/">dentists</a>). If you disagree with our criteria, you can at least
                    understand why we ranked something the way we did.</p>

                <h3>3. Real Research, Not Aggregation</h3>
                <p>We don't just scrape Yelp reviews or aggregate other lists. Our editors evaluate portfolios, verify
                    credentials, analyze outcomes, and when possible, conduct site visits. Rankings take weeks of
                    research, not hours of compilation.</p>

                <h3>4. Context Over Simple Lists</h3>
                <p>We explain <em>why</em> something ranks where it does and <em>who</em> it's best for. The #1 dentist
                    may not be right for you if they don't take your insurance or specialize in pediatric care when you
                    need implants. We provide decision frameworks, not just ordered lists.</p>

                <h3>5. Continuous Updates</h3>
                <p>Rankings aren't "set and forget." We review categories quarterly, update for major changes within 30
                    days, and track all revisions in a <a href="/changelog/">public changelog</a>. You'll always know
                    when rankings were last verified.</p>

                <h2>How We Make Money</h2>
                <p>Currently, Rankin is self-funded. Our planned revenue model includes:</p>
                <ul style="margin: 20px 0; padding-left: 20px;">
                    <li><strong>Display advertising</strong> - Clearly labeled ads that never influence rankings</li>
                    <li><strong>Premium research reports</strong> - Deep-dive category analysis for businesses</li>
                    <li><strong>Data licensing</strong> - Anonymized ranking data for market research</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We will <strong>never</strong> accept money from ranked businesses for placement, affiliate
                    commissions from referrals, or "native advertising" that disguises ads as rankings.</p>

                <h2>Our Team</h2>
                <p>Rankin is built by a small team of researchers, editors, and developers who believe the internet
                    needs more trustworthy information resources.</p>

                <p><strong>Editorial Team:</strong> Our editors have backgrounds in journalism, research, and
                    subject-matter expertise across the categories we cover. We hire specialists (e.g., a dentist
                    reviews dental rankings) to ensure evaluations are informed by actual domain knowledge.</p>

                <p><strong>Research Standards:</strong> Every editor signs an editorial ethics agreement prohibiting
                    conflicts of interest, acceptance of gifts from ranked businesses, and manipulation of rankings for
                    any reason beyond published criteria.</p>

                <h2>Editorial Principles</h2>
                <ol style="margin: 20px 0; padding-left: 20px;">
                    <li><strong>Independence:</strong> Rankings are never influenced by business relationships,
                        advertising, or pressure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> We publish our methods, criteria weights, and data sources.</li>
                    <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> We verify facts, correct errors promptly, and acknowledge mistakes
                        publicly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Helpfulness:</strong> Our goal is useful information, not SEO content farms or
                        engagement bait.</li>
                    <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> We provide contact information and respond to corrections
                        within 5 business days.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Read our complete <a href="/editorial-policy/">Editorial Policy</a> for detailed standards.</p>

                <h2>Coverage Roadmap</h2>
                <p>We're starting with three categories (design studios, dentists, gyms) across five major U.S. cities.
                    Our expansion plan:</p>
                <ul style="margin: 20px 0; padding-left: 20px;">
                    <li><strong>Q1 2026:</strong> Add 10 more cities, 2 more categories</li>
                    <li><strong>Q2 2026:</strong> Launch international rankings (London, Toronto, Berlin)</li>
                    <li><strong>Q3 2026:</strong> Add 5 more categories based on user requests</li>
                    <li><strong>Q4 2026:</strong> Regional coverage (suburbs, secondary cities)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Category and location priorities are based on user demand and our ability to execute high-quality
                    research. We'd rather cover fewer things well than many things poorly.</p>
